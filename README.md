# ztricks-v1

## Description
An addon for [Counter-Strike: Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/) using [EventScripts](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/EventScripts) to detect **tricks** when players have touched enough points around the surf map without dying.

## History
I switched from [|тطω|MaکŦergںŋ](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978487378/)'s fy_iceworld server to [Pharmacist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b5bMCraWBA)'s surf_skyworld server in 2009. Shortly after buying permanent admin for $50, I got ftp access and started looking at addons.

All the addons were written in ES Tools. Essentially they were scripts being executed on the server console. Variables and functions were practically impossible. Luckily though, a Python 2.x release had already been started. Python addons had a lot of bonuses such as shared memory. You could share data between addons through the **es** import.

Regions of the map couldn't be accurately represented with cubes and spheres alone. I spent endless nights calculating triangles on paper using coordinates found in the map [dxf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF) exports. Research continued in a cold basement cement basement after being evicted.

These files were recovered from a hard drive used at the time.
